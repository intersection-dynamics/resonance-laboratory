# resonance-laboratory
Independent lab exploring emergent spacetime, causality &amp; fermionic statistics from unitary dynamics + decoherence in finite Hilbert space. Current project: GPU-accelerated substrate showing fermions survive longest under noise (73 % universality with phase-sensitive detection). Open code, open results, open to collaboration.
